# Demonstration code for "Building a complete RL system" lecture

## Introduction
This code demonstrates our implementation of SARSA for a deterministic FrozenLake task and serves as additional information to go alongside the "Building a complete Rl system" lecture.
The lecture is delivered as part of the [Reinforcement Learning (2020) course](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/cxinfr11010.html) at the University of Edinburgh.

## Dependencies
To run any python scripts, you will need [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) which can be installed using

    pip install gym

To run the jupyter notebook provided with the code, follow the instructions on the [Jupyter mainpage](https://jupyter.org/).

## Code
All code is written in Python3 and provided as separate scripts and all-together in one Jupyter notebook available [here](https://github.com/LukasSchaefer/RL2020_Building-a-Complete-RL-System_Demonstration/blob/master/rl_demo.ipynb).
